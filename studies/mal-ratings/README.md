# MAL Ratings

For this study, I will be using the MyAnimeList Anime Recommendations Database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database).

## Usage

Download the data from above and put it in the `datasets` directory (make sure it is on the root project level). The Jupyter notebooks will be created linearly with the order below, so that is the recommended reading order.

1. [Preliminary Analysis](Preliminary_Analysis.ipynb)


## Future Plans

* Visualize anime into lower dimensions
* Run linear and logistic regressions
* Use the anime metadata for similarity analysis
* Implement ["Solving Cold-Start Problem in Large-scale Recommendation Engines: A Deep Learning Approach"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05480) by Yuan, Jianbo, et al. for cold start recommendation
